![logo](https://github.com/Mgit125/Power-BI-Project/blob/main/1.png)

## Project Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis on USA bank loan data using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for interactive visualizations. The analysis aims to provide insights into the distribution and status of loans across different states, as well as key loan metrics such as loan amount, interest rates, and repayment status.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate skills in SQL for data extraction, transformation, and querying, as well as Power BI for designing an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. The project will analyze loan data to highlight trends, patterns, and insights to assist bank managers in making data-driven decisions.

## Tools Used:
SQL Database Management Tools: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Reporting Tools: Power BI (for interactive dashboards)

## Key Features:

#### Key Loan Metrics (KPI's):

Visual: KPI cards showing the total number of loans, average loan amount, and average interest rate.
Description: These KPIs provide an at-a-glance view of key metrics related to the bank's loan portfolio, helping management quickly assess the portfolio's health.

#### Good vs. Bad Loans Issued (Donut Chart):

Visual: Donut chart depicting the percentage of Good Loans (Fully Paid, Current) vs. Bad Loans (Defaulted, Charged Off).
Description: This chart helps visualize loan performance, showing the proportion of successful vs. risky loans.
Insight: Financial institutions can quickly assess the quality of their loan portfolio based on the percentage of good vs. bad loans, aiding in risk management and future lending strategies.

#### Loan Funded Amount vs. Loan Received Amount (Bar Chart):
Visual: Bar chart comparing the loan amounts funded by the bank vs. the loan amounts received by borrowers on a monthly basis.
Description: This chart tracks how much funding is approved versus the actual amount received by the borrowers, providing insights into the disbursement efficiency.

#### Loan Applications by Month (Bar Chart):
Visual: Bar chart showing monthly loan application trends.
Description: Helps track loan application volume over time, aiding in trend analysis for business growth and loan demand forecasting.

#### Loan Distribution by State:

Visual: Shape map showing loan distribution across states in the USA.
Description: This map provides a geographical overview of the total number of loans issued in each state, helping to identify high-demand regions for loan services.

#### Loan Status Analysis:

Visual: Clustered Bar chart comparing different loan statuses (e.g., Fully Paid, Current, Defaulted, Charged Off).
Description: This visual allows viewers to compare the performance of loans across the states and understand the proportion of good vs. bad loans.

#### Interest Rate Distribution:

Visual: Histogram of interest rates.
Description: Provides insight into the distribution of interest rates across the loan portfolio, helping to identify trends in the pricing of loans.

##### Loan Amount by Loan Status:

Visual: Stacked bar chart showing loan amounts categorized by loan status.
Description: This chart helps to analyze the total loan amounts and their respective statuses, highlighting which statuses contribute to a higher share of loan amounts.

#### Loan Term Analysis (Donut Charts):

Visual: Donut charts showcasing the breakdown of loans based on their terms (e.g.36 months, 60 months).
Description: These visuals allow users to see the proportion of loans issued for different loan term lengths, helping understand borrowing trends and customer preferences.
Insight: The 36-month term might dominate, indicating customer preference for mid-term loans.

#### Loan Applications by Employee Experience/Length (Bar Chart):
Visual: Bar chart categorizing loan applications by the borrowerâ€™s employment length.
Description: This chart provides insights into the loan application trends based on employee experience, revealing whether borrowers with longer employment history tend to apply for more loans.

#### Loan Applications by Loan Purpose (Bar Chart):
Visual: Bar chart breaking down loan applications by their stated purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses).
Description: This chart shows the most common reasons for taking loans, offering insights into customer needs and priorities.

#### Total Loan Applications by Home Ownership (Bar Chart):
Visual: Bar chart showing loan applications categorized by home ownership status (e.g., owned, rented, mortgage).
Description: Provides insights into how home ownership affects loan application trends.

## Challenges & Solutions:
Data Cleaning: SQL queries were used to clean and preprocess raw loan data, addressing issues like missing or inconsistent values.
Data Modeling: Relationships between tables in Power BI allowed for cross-dimensional analysis, making it easier to derive insights from various factors like state, loan term, purpose, and home ownership.
Performance Optimization: DAX was employed to optimize the calculations for large datasets, ensuring smooth interactivity in the Power BI dashboard.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize bank loan data. The addition of monthly loan application analysis, loan amounts funded/received, home ownership insights, and loan purpose provide a comprehensive view of loan performance, trends, and borrower behavior.
